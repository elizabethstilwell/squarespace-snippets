/* Gradient Overlay on Poster Image 

Add an Image Block with the Poster Design Style to the page youâ€™d like your image on.

Next, go to the Custom CSS Editor. Copy and paste the code below into the Custom CSS Editor box.

Change the background color values #F07C63 and #E45372  to the color codes of your choice.

Make sure you do not have an overlay on the image within Site Styles already. If you do, you can remove it.
